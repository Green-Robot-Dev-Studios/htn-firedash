## Inspiration

Operational fire alarms are crucial requirements in one's home to ensure their safety and chances of survival during a fire hazard. According to the NFPA, smoke alarms didnâ€™t sound in 47% of the home fires reported to U.S. fire departments in 2009-2013. We created FireDash to help others maintain their smoke alarms in good conditions and increase awareness of their importance.

## What it does

It provides a dashboard system for insurance companies and fire departments. They would be able to see all the users on a google map and identify if their fire alarms are well maintained. (Users who meet all the criterias for a well maintained fire alarm system will receive green checks.) 
Taking pictures of the installation to forward to insurance. This is a criteria to receive a green check.
It alerts users every month to do a routine check of their fire alarm system (criteria to receive a green check.) We created a voiceflow system to assist users in these checkups. It can also be used on an amazon echo and google home! It guides users through what problems they need to identify on their smoke detectors and provide a to-do list with all the repairs they need to make. It also gives users tips and advice on how to make the necessary repairs.

## Applications

**Insurance companies**

Our idea is that insurance companies can provide lower rates for people who use the app because their fire alarm systems naturally are in better condition than the average person. However, if the matter is not taken seriously and the user does not receive their green check, insurance rates will consequently increase. 

**Fire departments**

The app provides fire departments with a map of all application users. It also replaces going door to door to check up on their fire alarm system. The app automatically does it for them!

## How we built it

We used flutter and the google maps api for the frontend. We used Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage for the database as well as Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications. For the chatbot component, we used voiceflow with custom code blocks.

## Challenges we ran into

The main challenging aspects were building complex logic into voiceflow and using the google maps api. 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

We are proud of our concept and idea because it is very unique and it has never been done before. We think it can potentially have a big positive effect on this world. We are also proud of the google maps based dashboard.

## What we learned

We learned how to use Voiceflow. It was a great experience and we feel like it could be an invaluable tool in our next projects.

## What's next for FireDash

We would like to market our idea to insurance companies and fire stations across the country, hopefully lowering the amount of annual fire deaths and damages caused by fires.
